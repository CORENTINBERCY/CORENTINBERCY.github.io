<p>A first experience in San Francisco in March 2019 during a "digital expedition" allowed me to enter a different country and culture and develop my practice of English, particularly through investigations related to issues specific to the city of San Francisco. 
    Today, I would like to develop my experience in a company and join a sales department. I am also interested in digital, marketing and international relations. Here a picture of my friend Max (who's a french/british) and I.
